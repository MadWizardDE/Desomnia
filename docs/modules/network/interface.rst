Interface selection
===================


- **Linux**: You usually use the designated device name, like ``eth0``, ``eth1``, etc.
- **Windows**: You can either use the name of the device like ``Ethernet``, as it appears inside the settings app, or use the unambiguously id ``{1BD73899-523C-4911-967A-FE797ACF6C44}`` of the network interface.
